# D2NN
This project is a recovery of the papar _**All-optical machine learning using diffractive deep neural networks**_ in pytorch. 

## Utilize the Angular Spectrum Method to simulate the wave propagation. 
## Add phase to the light with Exp(i\theta)
## Create the loss function with Gaussion Points rather than the squares for converging fastly.
## Loss backward.
